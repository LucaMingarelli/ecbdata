# Development ideas

1. Creating a function/some functions to download data in the various available formats:
    - CSV
    - SDMX-ML 2.1 Generic Data
    - SDMX-ML 2.1 Structure Specific Data format
    - JSON
    
    Additionally, we can also retrieve the various data in a *zipped* folder.

2. Metadata Download

3. Adding documentation, like a Jupyter notebook showcasing the API functionalities.
